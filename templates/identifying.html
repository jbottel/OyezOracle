					<h3 class="top">Learning From The Transcript</h3>
							<p>Any statements that are made by the justices are telling. They sometimes will cut off a lawyer while they are speaking, although sometimes they will wait for a pause. The justices each have their own personality. Justice Clarence Thomas is well-known for not speaking at all during oral argument. Sometimes a justice will ask "why" or "how", indiciating that they want the advocate to further explain. Sometimes a justice will say words like "wrong," which could be an indiciator that they disagree with what the advocate is saying.</p>
<p>It is features like these that OyezOracle uses to make its predictions. A listing of features can found below:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Number of statements per argument</li>
<li>Number of words per statement</li>
<li>Number of times a statement was an interruption</li>
<li>Number of occurences of the phrase "Don't Know"</li>
<li>Number of occurences of the word "Why"</li>
<li>Number of occurences of the word "Wrong"</li>
<li>Number of nouns, proper nouns, etc.</li>
<li>Number of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<a name="nlp"></a>
<h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
<p>OyezOracle uses the <code>nltk</code> package to perform natural language processing. The major extent of this process is to identify the number of times a specific part-of-speech is used. In fact, this is the most processor-intensive part of the transcript analysis.</p>
<a name="nltk"></a>
<h4>Features from NLTK</h4>
<p>OyezOracle uses a set of feature <em>codes</em> to build a vector of features as a neural network input. A significant portion of these features is made up of the NLTK-determined parts-of-speech. The NLTK feature codes can be seen below.
<pre><code class="python">nltk_features = [ "CC",
    "CD",
    "DT",
    "EX",
    "FW",
    "IN",
    "JJ",
    "JJR",
    "JJS",
    "LS",
    "MD",
    "NN",
    "NNS",
    "NNP",
    "NNPS",
    "PDT",
    "POS",
    "PRP",
    "PRP$",
    "RB",
    "RBR",
    "RBS",
    "RP",
    "SYM",
    "TO",
    "UH",
    "VB",
    "VBD",
    "VBG",
    "VBN",
    "VBP",
    "VBZ",
    "WDT",
    "WP",
    "WP$",
    "WRB"
]</code></pre>
<a name="code"></a>
<h4>Additional Feature Codes</h4>
<p>There are a few additional features that don't come from NLTK that make up the set of features for the neural network. The names of these features can be seen below.</p>
<pre><code class="python">additional_feature_codes = [
    "MQSCORE",
    "NUMSTM",
    "AVGWRD",
    "NUMINTR",
    "NUMDK",
    "NUMWHY",
    "NUMWNG", 
]</code></pre> 

<a name="mq"></a>
<h4>Martin-Quinn Scores</h4>
<p>An additional feature considered by OyezOracle is called a Martin-Quinn score. This is a score, created in process described by Martin and Quinn, which gives a numerical measure
of the liberal/conservative ideology of a justice. These scores allow for some measure of ideological concerns to come into the prediction, which is a very obvious indicator to anyone
who is familiar with the supreme court. </p>
<pre><code class="python">mq_scores = {
    "ALTO": 2.037,
    "BRY": -1.729,
    "GIN": -2.461,
    "KAG": -1.913,
    "KEN": -0.150,
    "ROBT": 0.869,
    "SCAL": 1.583,
    "SOTO": -2.354,
    "THOM": 3.240,
}</code></pre>
